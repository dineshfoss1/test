If your team is like ours, you’re using pull requests for code review. Often times, you have changes you need to make based on feedback from your teammates before your code is merged. Editing online shouldn’t get in your way. The Bitbucket online editor allows you to edit your open pull requests directly. We’ll even update your pull request for you once you’ve committed your changes.

Built with CodeMirror
At the core of the Bitbucket online editor is CodeMirror – an excellent open-source JavaScript code editor component. The project’s terrific extension API as well as its top-notch documentation made implementation nearly painless. In addition, the friendly MIT license, the editor’s blazing-fast performance, and the project’s support for a wide number of languages made the choice of CodeMirror an easy one.
